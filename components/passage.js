      <h3>Historical background</h3>
      <p>
        The writer of this epistle was evidently the half-brother of our Lord
        Jesus Christ (Gal. 1:19) and the brother of Jude, the writer of the
        epistle that bears his name (cf. Matt. 13:55). This was the opinion of
        many of the early church fathers and writers.[1] This James was not the
        brother of the Apostle John, the son of Zebedee, who suffered martyrdom
        early in the history of the church (Mark 1:19; Acts 12:2). Neither was
        he the son of Alphaeus (Mark 3:18) or the father of Judas (Luke 6:16).
        He was the leading man in the Jerusalem church who spoke at the
        Jerusalem Council (Acts 15:13-21; cf. 12:17; 21:18; 1 Cor. 15:7).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some commentators believed that the similarities in the Greek of this
        epistle and Jamesâ€™ speech in Acts 15 support his identification as the
        writer.[2] The fact that the writer wrote this epistle in very good
        Greek should not rule this James out. He would have been fluent in both
        Aramaic and Greek as a gifted Galilean. The recipients of this letter
        were the Jewish Christians of the Diaspora, Jews who had scattered from
        Palestine and had come to faith in Christ (1:1). Several Jewish
        references in the book support the claim that a Jew wrote it to other
        Jews (e.g., 1:18; 2:2, 21; 3:6; 5:4, 7).
