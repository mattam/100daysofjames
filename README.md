## 100 Days of James

This is an experiment in building out a Bible experience around the book of James
I'll attempt to build out ideas and tooling around reading the book of James over the course of 100 days
You can access the most recent demo at: [https://100daysofjames.vercel.app/](https://100daysofjames.vercel.app/)
Each day's experiments are linked to the PR for that day.
